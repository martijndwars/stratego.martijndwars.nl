"description": "\nCHANGES (by Joost Visser)\n\nStrategy pack-modules(pack, dep-base) now takes two additonal\noptions:\n-dep target\n-nodep\n\nThe first one specifies the maketarget and basename of the\ndependency file that is created. If this option is not passed,\nthe argument dep-base is used instead. Finally, the -nodep option\ncan be used to disable this and prevent any dependency file to\nbe created. Note that -dep takes precendence over -nodep.\n\nAn additional strategy pack-modules(pack) was added that behaves\nlike pack-modules, except no default for the dependency file\nbase name needs to be specified. Hence, only the command line\noptions are relevant.\n\nby Eelco Visser (2002-12-18):\nRefactored using new (config-style) option handling.\n\n",
